## Description & Deployment
This is an app meant to aid any traveler who is in dire need of last-minute packing recommendations or clothing ideas. This app is best used near to the date of travel to display the weather conditions in the city of interest and then recommend the best outfits to bring on the trip based on the weather.

and they will be ready to use the app.

## Usage
First sign up with your name, email, password, and gender.  The app will log you in and you can begin by entering your destination city. Click the submit button and the app will serve you the weather (hopefully something warm) and some sweet clothing options that you can save for your reference later.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, we plan to expand the app, giving the users a much wider range of clothing options, the ability to choose clothing based on sizing, as well as to save their trip information including the location, weather, and clothing for reference later.
